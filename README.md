## About

Eat-da-Burger is a web app leveraging several different technologies to retrieve user-provided burger information, write it to a MySQL database,
and then update or delete it if the user should choose. The front end is built with Bootstrap and Handlebars, and the backend is built with 
Node, Express, and MySQL.

## Prerequisites 

None! 

## Challenges

The biggest challenge I ran into with this application was the deployment to Heroku. It's still unsuccessful as of the submission.
